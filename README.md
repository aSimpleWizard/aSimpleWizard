<h2>Hello, everyone.

My name is Jaime Hern√°ndez, am a software development student in Las Americas' Technology Institute (Dominican republic).

I know the basics of C++, C#, Php, Python, and others. Still, I have much to learn.

My objective, for now, is to try a bit of everything before choosing a branch in the Software Development world.
